# Ollama Notebook

Ask AI about your documents for free and locally!

This project was made for people who want to use RAG systems without uploading their documents to third-party services like Google.

It runs completely **locally** using Ollama and a local LLM.

## 🧠 How It Works

- You upload documents (TXT, PDF, etc.)
- The system generates embeddings
- It performs semantic (vector) search
- A local LLM (Phi-4 via Ollama) answers your questions using your documents as context
